### KPIs
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are used to measure the effectiveness of each service:

- **Service Interruption Count**: Tracks the number of service interruptions detected.
- **Restoration Time**: Measures the average time taken to restore service after an interruption.
- **Service Degradation Events**: Monitors the number of events where service performance is below acceptable thresholds.
- **User Sign-ins**: Counts the number of successful user sign-ins.
- **Logon Errors**: Tracks the number of failed login attempts.
- **Risky Login Events**: Monitors login attempts that have been flagged as risky.
- **User Additions**: Counts the number of users added to Azure AD.
- **License Changes**: Tracks changes made to user licenses.
- **Password Resets**: Monitors the frequency of user password resets.
- **Role Member Additions**: Counts the number of times users are added to roles.
- **Role Member Removals**: Tracks the number of times users are removed from roles.
- **Failed Login Attempts**: Counts the number of unsuccessful login attempts.
- **Authentication Method Usage**: Monitors the usage of different authentication methods.
- **Abnormal Login Patterns**: Detects login patterns that deviate from the norm, indicating potential security issues.
- **Group Additions**: Counts the number of groups added to Azure AD.
- **Group Removals**: Tracks the number of groups removed from Azure AD.
- **Domain Authentication Changes**: Monitors changes to domain authentication settings.
